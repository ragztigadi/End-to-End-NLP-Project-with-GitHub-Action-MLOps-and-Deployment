![NLP Project](https://your_project_image_url_here)

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text summarization. It utilizes state-of-the-art models and incorporates GitHub Actions for continuous integration, MLOps for managing the machine learning lifecycle, and automated deployment for seamless integration into production environments.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of input text documents.
- **GitHub Action Integration**: Automated workflows ensure smooth integration and testing with each code change.
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Streamlined management of the machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment.
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment enables easy integration of the text summarization model into production environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    cd your_repository
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up necessary configurations:

    - Configure your dataset paths and other settings in `config.py`.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Running  data preprocessing scripts to preprocess the dataset.

    ```bash
    python data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. **Model Training**:
    - Trained the text summarization model using the preprocessed dataset.

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Deployment**:
    - Deployed the trained model using the provided deployment scripts.
    
    ```bash
    sh deploy_model.sh
    ```

## Continuous Integration

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Upon each push to the repository, automated workflows run tests to ensure the integrity and functionality of the codebase.

## MLOps Pipeline

The MLOps pipeline manages the entire machine learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It ensures consistency and reliability in the development and deployment of the text summarization model.

## Deployment

Automated deployment scripts enable seamless integration of the text summarization model into production environments. Deployments are triggered automatically upon successful model training.
